Today I just earned my third MCTS certification: [**Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, ASP.NET Application Development.**](http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-562&locale=en-us)

The exam was good and under my expectations. Not very hard you've been working with ASP.NET on a daily basis for quite some time. For the ones that are planning on taking this exam in the future, be aware that you'll face some mobile development specific question, of which I am not very familiar with. ASP.NET AJAX and ADO.NET topics appear extensively through the exam. It is composed of a total of 50 questions, spanned in seven topics:

- Configuring and deploying web applications
- Consuming and creating server controls
- Working with data and services
- Troubleshooting and debugging web applications
- Working with ASP.NET AJAX and client-side scripting
- Targeting mobile devices
- Programming web applications

The passing score is 700/100 (as always). My score was 810! :)
