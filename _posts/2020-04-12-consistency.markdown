I pretty much always had a side project that I've focused on during my free time. They've fallen in a wide variety of categories, from small pet projects (eg.: playing with libraries and tools that I wanted to learn more about) to bigger and more ambitious ideas that I wanted to eventually "succeed" and have paying users for it. That ended up never happening, [except once](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinverse), with Coinverse, for a brief period of time only.

The vast majority of them either ended up being shelved (abandoned), mostly because I ended up losing interest on it. I guess that once things get boring and no longer challenging, that's when I stop working on it and focus on something new.

**Side projects are a great way to learn new things, experiment, try and fail in a safe and controlled environment, with low stakes, where having fun is the only goal.**

Recently I've realized how my approach has changed drastically over the years. I still remember the first project I launched publicly with friends, [Noite Hoje](http://noitehoje.com.br/). It was an aggregator for parties, concerts and events for (usually young) people who wanted to find something to do on a Friday or Saturday night, for example, and didn't know what events were happening around them. I remember being extremely thrilled about it, working nights and weekends nonstop. We were a group of friends, young and naive. I recall us discussing about how that could become a huge project with millions of paying users. So foolish ðŸ˜€. We did end up making some noise though, being featured in [local newspapers](https://link.estadao.com.br/blogs/daniel-gonzales/dez-apps-de-musica-e-entretenimento-para-android-ios-e-windows-phone/) and [media outlets](https://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2011/08/noite-hoje-mostra-melhores-baladas-e-shows-da-sua-cidade-no-celular.html), but it didn't last for very long. It was a wild and short ride with a lot of drama included. Needless to say, the project is [now archived](https://github.com/noitehoje).

I'm now working on [something new](https://clairvoyancehq.com/) which I'm again thrilled about in a way that I haven't been in a long time, probably years. This time, however, I want to make sure this doesn't end up in an archived Github repo again. I want to make sure I don't lose interest and move over to the next shiny thing as it has happened over and over again. I think the key is **consistency**.

Instead of working nights and weekends nonstop, as I have many times before, which is not sustainable, this time I want to pace myself and make it last in the long run. In the end, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Time to market is key, but what's the point if you get burned out and abandon it weeks later?

> Do something every day. It almost doesn't matter what it is, as long as you do something.

Fix a bug, a typo. Update a layout. Merge a pull request. Document a class. It doesn't matter how small it is, as long as you do it consistently.

This applies to so many areas that it almost feels like beating a dead horse, old news. Exercise every day. Eat healthy every day. Sleep well every night. The power of compound growth is often underestimated and humans often have a hard time grasping it.
