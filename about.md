<img class="about-avatar" src="/images/about.png"/>

I'm a Brazilian Software Engineer from [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre)
with over 10 years of experience. BSc in Computer Science from [PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/).

I've worked for companies like HP, ThoughtWorks and Airbnb and also co-founded
a couple of small startups. I currently live in Seattle and work for [Stripe](stripe.com). I'm an advocate for clean, maintainable and testable code.

As a typical soccer fanatic, I support my howetown team [Gremio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%AAmio_Foot-Ball_Porto_Alegrense). My dog (in the picture above) is called Chaves, as a homage to Chespirito's character in the TV show [El Chavo del Ocho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chavo_del_Ocho). Chespirito which was a big part of my infancy and still, to this day, is to me one of the greatest comedians of all time.
