<img alt="me photobombing" title="me photobombing" src="/images/about-photo.png"/>

I currently live in the beautiful and rainy Seattle, which is where I call home, in the heart of the
[Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).
However, I was proudly born and raised in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre),
south of Brazil.

I've been working in the tech industry for over 10 years and hold a bachelors degree in Computer Science
from [PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/). You can find my [resume here]({{ "/assets/resume_felipe_lima.pdf" | relative_url }}).

Over these years, I've worked for several companies like ThoughtWorks, Airbnb and,
most recently, Stripe. In 2014 I've co-founded a crypto startup which was later acquired.

Currently I'm taking a break from full time work and the "big tech" industry to recharge, focus on learning and
experimenting with new projects and technologies. I'm a minimalist at heart and believe that the best
code is no code at all ðŸ˜€.

As a typical soccer fanatic, I support my howetown team [Gremio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%AAmio_Foot-Ball_Porto_Alegrense).

**Interests:**

- Data visualization
- Programming languages
- Type systems
- Psychology
- Cryptocurrencies
- Security
