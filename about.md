<img class="about-avatar" src="/images/about.png"/>

I currently live in the beautiful and rainy Seattle, which is where I call home, in the heart of the
[Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest).
However, I was proudly born and raised in [Porto Alegre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Porto_Alegre),
south of Brazil.

I've been working in the tech industry for over 10 years and hold a bachelors degree in Computer Science
from [PUCRS](http://www.pucrs.br/). You can find my [resume here]({{ "/assets/resume_felipe_lima.pdf" | relative_url }}).

Over the years, I've worked for several companies, big and small, like HP, ThoughtWorks and Airbnb
and also co-founded a couple of startups. Currently, I work for [Stripe](stripe.com) as a Software
Engineer, building payments infrastructure for Latin America. I'm an advocate for clean,
maintainable and testable code. I also believe that the best code is no code at all ðŸ˜€.

As a typical futbol (soccer) fanatic, I support my howetown team [Gremio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gr%C3%AAmio_Foot-Ball_Porto_Alegrense).

My dog (in the picture above) is called Chaves, as a homage to Chespirito's character in the TV show
[El Chavo del Ocho](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Chavo_del_Ocho). Chespirito which was a big part of
my infancy and still, to this day, is to me one of the greatest comedians of all time.
