  <div class="entry-content"><p>If you&#8217;ve been on the latest news on the web development standards, you probably know that <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML_5">HTML version 5</a> is slowly being adopted by mainstream browsers, despite it has not reached its final release yet (it is still a draft). I&#8217;ve always been a fan of the impressive results that you can get with Adobe Flash and, since it is today present in <a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/player_census/flashplayer/version_penetration.html">almost 99% of the browsers</a>, it has been almost a no-brainer for anyone that wanted to create a highly dynamic and interactive website for the last couple years. Despite its many drawbacks, Flash has managed to become almost ubiquitous and extremely popular in the web. Just to cite a few of these weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>It is a proprietary technology held by Adobe. This, by definition, is not good for the community, since we&#8217;re all in Adobe&#8217;s hands;</p></li>
<li><p>Even after 10 major releases during the last 13 years, Adobe did not managed to create a decent IDE for it, which today still relies mainly on a timeframe for movie clip creation and has poor debugging support;</p></li>
<li><p>Its programming language, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript">ActionScript</a>, which only recently became more robust with its version 3, is based on ECMAScript (prototype oriented), which implies loose typing and few compile time checks -> more runtime errors.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Now that HTML5 is here, we&#8217;re clearly seeing that Flash is slowly and progressively losing market share, mostly because of the new <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canvas_%28HTML_element%29"><strong>canvas</strong></a> element introduced with this standard. Canvas allows 2D vector based drawing directly to the browser. This opens an entire new world of possibilities to web development, allowing creators to leverage the HTML 5 open standard to switch from Flash to canvas and, therefore, forcing browsers to implement it and improve rendering performance. Other elements like audio and video embedding are also planned to be available in this standard.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001023.html">Performance</a> is another topic apart that, however, cannot be ignored. Some of the latest <a href="http://www.chromeexperiments.com/">canvas experiments</a> in the web show that we have a severe performance reduction with canvas, when compared to Flash, especially when it comes to animations and 3D. This is something that still blows me today: How do browsers manage to have such a big performance difference? Google Chrome, which is the fastest browser i&#8217;ve ever seen, cannot be compared to Firefox when it comes to JavaScript performance, not to mention Internet Explorer, which must be some kind of joke of internet browsers. Even its latest version 8 did not manage to have half of the Chrome speed. I cannot understand what is so hard about JavaScript processing which makes it such a processor intensive task even for the modern browsers.</p>

<p>I really wish to see the web in the near future in a very different way than what we have now. With the adpotion of HTML 5 by all mainstream browsers (IE does not implement it yet), I hope we can all abandon Flash for good and focus on improving browsers performance to be able to afford with canvas the same interactivity that we have today with Flash. Besides that, I&#8217;d like to see more and more improvements to JavaScript frameworks like jQuery and hopefully, we&#8217;ll enter Web 3.0 with an entire new set of web applications!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>While trying to use the Session state dictionary in a web application, you may eventually receive the following exception:</p>

<p><strong>Session state can only be used when enableSessionState is set to true, </strong><strong>either in a configuration file or in the Page directive. Please also make sure that System.Web.SessionStateModule or a custom session state module is included in the <configuration>&lt;system.web>&lt;httpModules> </strong><strong>section in the application configuration.</strong></p>

<p>To my surprise, session state has to be enabled before it can be used. I followed some steps that I found while digging for the solution online that might be helpful:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Enable the ASP.NET Session State Manager Service (under Control Panel > Administrative Tools > Services)</p></li>
<li><p>Enable it in the web.config file: <strong><pages enableSessionState="true"></strong></p></li>
<li><p>Add the proper http module to the web.config: <strong><add name="Session" type="System.Web.SessionState.SessionStateModule" /></strong></p></li>
<li><p>At last but not least: Make sure you&#8217;re accessing the Session object after it has been initialized. This is very important, since if you try to manipulate it in the page constructor, for example (which was my case), you&#8217;ll still get the above exception, even after executing steps 1, 2 and 3. You should be able to access it after the page <strong>OnLoad</strong> event has been fired.</p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>How to use the results of a database query using Linq to fill a DataGrid? It should be no big deal since there is a useful <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb396189.aspx">CopyToDataTable</a> extension method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; DataTable CopyToDataTable&lt;T&gt;(

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt; IEnumerable&lt;T&gt; source

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;)

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;where&lt;/span&gt; T : DataRow
</code></pre>

<p>However, there is a problem: <strong>T has to be a DataRow</strong>. When returning query results from the database, especially with EF, your query results are not DataRows (and I wonder if the same is true for Linq to Sql too). So, in this case, you&#8217;ll have to fill the DataTable by hand. Thanks to this <a href="http://unboxedsolutions.com/sean/archive/2009/06/06/15961.aspx">good blog post</a>, I was able to fill it:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;DataTable dataTable = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; DataTable();

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;dataTable.TableName = &lt;span class="str"&gt;"ResultsTable"&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;dataTable.Columns.Add(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"User"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;));

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;dataTable.Columns.Add(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"TotalJobs"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;));

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;var query = &lt;span class="rem"&gt;/* your linq query comes here. no restrictions! */&lt;/span&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>we have the DataTable and the query set up. Now, the tricky part!</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;var results = query.Select(anonym =&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; Func&lt;DataRow, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;, DataRow&gt;(

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;    (DataRow row, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; index, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; count) =&gt;

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    {

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;        row[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"User"&lt;/span&gt;] = index;

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt;        row[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"TotalJobs"&lt;/span&gt;] = count;

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; row;

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    })

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;    .Invoke(dataTable.NewRow(), anonym.Index, anonym.TotalJobs));

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt; 

&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;results.ToList().ForEach(row =&gt; dataTable.Rows.Add(row));
</code></pre>

<p>Absolutely a good piece of unreadable code :)</p>

<p><em>query </em>variable are your Linq query results, which may be an IEnumerable of some of your data entities or even a anonymous type. It doesn&#8217;t matter! For each element of this enumeration, we&#8217;re creating a DataRow and assigning some values to its columns. Then, we call <em>Invoke </em>to indeed invoke our anonymous delegate Func, passing in our anonymous type properties, that are used later to fill the DataTable.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll probably gonna need to read it a couple times to digest it a bit and still it will look &#8220;WTF did I really wrote this code?!?&#8221; after a couple days :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="/post/More-on-the-Entity-Framework.aspx">Some time ago</a>, I wrote about predicate building with the Entity Framework and how the use of AsExpandable solves the issue. Frequently, people see and ask me about the following error, which is also associated with the same root cause that I blogged about in my previous post. However, it may be a bit confusing as to what is the cause of the following exception:</p>

<p><strong><em>The LINQ expression node type &#8216;Invoke&#8217; is not supported in LINQ to Entities.</em></strong></p>

<p>Again, as I stated before, calling LinqKit&#8217;s <strong>AsExpandable </strong>solves this problem. As per <a href="http://tomasp.net/blog/linq-expand.aspx">Tomas Petricek</a> (the creator of a good part of this great work):</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>"(...) `ToExpandable` creates a thin wrapper around the DLINQ `Table` object.
Thanks to this wrapper you can use second method called `Invoke` that extends the `Expression`
class to invoke the lambda expression while making it still possible to translate query to T-SQL. This works
because when converting to the expression tree, the wrapper replaces all occurrences of `Invoke` method by
expression trees of the invoked lambda expression and passes these expressions to DLINQ that is able to translate
the expanded query to T-SQL."

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last days, while looking for a way to do image cropping in ASP.NET, I found out several high quality tools that do the job very well. The main one is a great jQuery plugin called <a href="http://deepliquid.com/content/Jcrop.html">jCrop</a>. It has many useful features out of the box coupled with a well forged look and feel, which made me choose to use it with no doubt.</p>

<p>What I needed, exactly, was a way to enable users to upload pictures and crop them on the fly before storing them on the website database. I often use ASP.NET <a href="http://asp.net/dynamicdata">dynamic data</a> to build complete and fully functional data driven websites in minutes. ASP.NET Dynamic Data is based on page templates and field templates that are brought together in runtime using user controls, in order to generate custom forms for manipulating the database tables.</p>

<p>One of these field templates, is DbImage, which is available in the Dynamic Data <a href="http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=27026">preview 4 on Codeplex</a>. Basically, it maps a binary table column to a user control that consists of a FileUpload control, which you can use to upload the image. Then, the image bytes are stored in the database. It is obviously not the best way to store images on a database, but it is extremely convenient. In an ideal scenario, the table would only point to the actual path of the image on the disk.</p>

<p>So, my work was to couple together jCrop and ASP.NET Dynamic Data DbImage control, so that the user may choose to crop the image just before it is saved to the database.</p>

<p>I found a very complete and interesting post on this topic at <a href="http://www.mikesdotnetting.com/Article/95/Upload-and-Crop-Images-with-jQuery-JCrop-and-ASP.NET">mikesdotnetting.com</a>, which handles the actual image cropping part of the work with C#.</p>

<p>My work was then based on Mike&#8217;s post and jCrop, putting it all together inside a DbImage to enable the whole workflow. The general flow is strongly based on Mike&#8217;s code using panels and hidden fields to store the selected X, Y, Width and Height, but I moved to a more wizard-like flow, which should be more straightforward to the regular user.</p>

<p>I first added a &#8220;Crop..&#8221; button to the control that should launch jCrop with the selected image file.</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/8/img1.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Next step was to open a AJAX <a href="http://www.asp.net/AJAX/AjaxControlToolkit/Samples/ModalPopup/ModalPopup.aspx">ModalPopupExtender</a> and show the selected image ready to be cropped with jCrop:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/8/img2new2.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>Last step, check the cropped image and finish the Wizard:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/8/img3.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>The cropped image is then scaled down and added to the form:</p>

<p><img src="/wp-content/uploads/2009/8/img4.jpg" alt="" /></p>

<p>In order to scale down the cropped image, I used a code from <a href="http://www.west-wind.com/Weblog/posts/283.aspx">Rick Strahl</a> and added to a page called GetThumb.aspx. This page receives the desired filename in the query string, fetches it from the crop temporary files directory and writes it to the response stream.</p>

<p>I am providing the whole set of files needed to accomplish this in a <a href="http://www.felipel.com/files/dbimage_crop.zip">zip file</a>. Follow these instructions for setup:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Put the DbImage_Edit.ascx<em> files in the **<dynamic data website>\DynamicData\FieldTemplates*</em> folder;</p></li>
<li><p>Put the GetThumb.aspx* files in the website root (&#8220;~&#8221; folder);</p></li>
<li><p>Put the Limaf.Tools.Web.dll file in  <dynamic data website>\bin folder (the Crop and Thumb functions are there).</p></li>
<li><p>Create an &#8216;images&#8217; folder in your project root</p></li>
</ol>


<p>If you prefer, you can copy/paste get Mike&#8217;s Crop and Rick&#8217;s Thumbnails functions yourself and build them as part of the website. In this case, step 3 above is not needed.</p>

<p>I may have forgotten a file or a step or two, so please let me know if anything goes wrong.</p>

<p>Till next time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I just earned my third MCTS certification: <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/learning/en/us/exam.aspx?ID=70-562&amp;locale=en-us"><strong>Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5, ASP.NET Application Development.</strong></a></p>

<p>The exam was good and under my expectations. Not very hard you&#8217;ve been working with ASP.NET on a daily basis for quite some time. For the ones that are planning on taking this exam in the future, be aware that you&#8217;ll face some mobile development specific question, of which I am not very familiar with. ASP.NET AJAX and ADO.NET topics appear extensively through the exam. It is composed of a total of 50 questions, spanned in seven topics:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Configuring and deploying web applications</p></li>
<li><p>Consuming and creating server controls</p></li>
<li><p>Working with data and services</p></li>
<li><p>Troubleshooting and debugging web applications</p></li>
<li><p>Working with ASP.NET AJAX and client-side scripting</p></li>
<li><p>Targeting mobile devices</p></li>
<li><p>Programming web applications</p></li>
</ul>


<p>The passing score is 700/100 (as always). My score was 810! <img src="/editors/tiny_mce/plugins/emotions/images/smiley-smile.gif" alt="Smile" /></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today my Firefox started behaving very strangely and extremely slow especially when using Gmail and Google Reader. I tried cleaning the cache, restarting but nothing solved. Then, I realized I had installed Skype these days and it installed a Firefox add-on without even asking me for permission. I removed the add-on and Firefox went back to normal operation, fast and reliable, as always.</p>

<p>I have to say that Skype dissappointed me this time installing a defective add-on on my browser, since I don&#8217;t even remember to have allowed it to do so.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&#8217;ve been very busy lately and unfortunately didn&#8217;t have enough time to stop here to write about things I have been working on. There are other subjects that I&#8217;d like to talk about but, for now, I&#8217;ll share my findings with asp.net user controls dynamically added to the page, difficulties, limitations and solutions.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m working on a Ajax based web site that basically contains a content area in the right, where I need to put the dynamic content, based on the user selection on the left menu. The ongoing work can be seen <a href="/admin/Pages/www.felipel.com/visiocore/ContentPage.aspx">here</a>.</p>

<p>The easier way to do this is to create an asp.net UserControl for the content of each page and to dynamically add each control to the page based on the user selection. I also added an UpdateProgress panel for better user experience. However, here is where the problems start. First off, you cannot simply instantiate an asp.net UserControl through its constructor and add it to the page. That won&#8217;t work. Instead, you&#8217;ll need to use the factory method Page.LoadControl(), providing it the virtual path to your control so that it returns the instance for you. Eg.:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;Control c = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.LoadControl(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"~/MyUserControl.ascx"&lt;/span&gt;);   &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Instantiate the user control&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.ContentArea.Controls.Add(c);    // Add it to the placeholder
</code></pre>

<p>Here, we&#8217;re instantiating the control and adding it to the page. So far, so good. But, what happens if your user control needs to execute some javascript function upon loading? Even if you explicitly put <script> tags in your user control markup, it won't be executed at this time, so the solution is to use RegisterStartupScript to execute the client code:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class="str"&gt;"some script key"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"&lt;script type="&lt;/span&gt;text/javascript&lt;span class="str"&gt;"&gt;alert('hello world!');&lt;/script&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>or, if you&#8217;re using Ajax, use the ScriptManager static method:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class="str"&gt;"some script key"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"&lt;script type="&lt;/span&gt;text/javascript&lt;span class="str"&gt;"&gt;alert('hello world!');&lt;/script&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;);
</code></pre>

<p>Put this and your user control will show up smoothly. If you don&#8217;t like the fact that the screen may remain unresponsive for some time with Ajax, you can use UpdateProgress to show a &#8220;Loading&#8221; text, for example, while the content is being loaded. This is fairly easy. Check out this <a href="http://www.asp.net/learn/ajax-videos/video-123.aspx">video</a>  for further information.</p>

<p>Okay, so now, what happens if we need to fire an event inside the UserControl in response to a user click on an image, for example? Right, the click event will fire a page postback and then the event handling code will be fired in the code behind as expected. Right? Definitely no! Since our user controls are being added dynamically to the page, they will not be there anymore after the postback. This means that ASP.Net will not find the control and, therefore, no event will be fired.</p>

<p>Let me refresh some facts about ASP.Net postback functionality before continuing&#8230; Whenever you click a server control in the page, javascript <strong>doPostBack function is called (except for Button and ImageButton, that use a different method - form post). The </strong>doPostBack function takes two arguments, eventTarget and eventArgument. The eventTarget contains the ID of the control that causes the postback and the eventArgument contains any additional data associated with the control. Upon page reload, ASP.Net checks both Request.Params[&#8221;<strong>EVENTTARGET&#8221;] and Request.Params[&#8221;</strong>EVENTARGUMENT&#8221;] parameters for any postback data. If it finds it, it looks for the control ID and method specified in the <strong>EVENTTARGET var and calls the specified method, passing the </strong>EVENTARGUMENT value as a parameter.</p>

<p>Said that and knowing that our dynamic user control won&#8217;t be present in the page during the postback, it is easy to conclude that ASP.Net won&#8217;t find the control for the ID in the __EVENTTARGET parameter and, consequently, nothing will happen.</p>

<p>Okay, so we need to re-add our user control to the page during the postback, so that ASP.Net will be able to find it and fire its event handler. In order to accomplish that, we can use the page ViewState to store the name of the control currently in the page, so that we can re-add it in the page OnLoad event.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   1:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;protected&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;override&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; OnLoad(EventArgs e)






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   2:  &lt;/span&gt;{






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   3:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;base&lt;/span&gt;.OnLoad(e);






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   4:  &lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   5:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   6:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (!&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.IsPostBack)






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   7:  &lt;/span&gt;    {






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   8:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// If this is not a postback, set our the initial content page&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;   9:  &lt;/span&gt;        ChangeSection(&lt;span class="str"&gt;"~/InitialControl.ascx"&lt;/span&gt;);






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  10:  &lt;/span&gt;    }






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  11:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;else&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  12:  &lt;/span&gt;    {






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  13:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Else, retrieve the CurrentControl value from the ViewState&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  14:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; currentSection = ViewState[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"CurrentControl"&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  15:  &lt;/span&gt;        Control c = ChangeSection(currentSection);    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Use the control name to add it to the page&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  16:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  17:  &lt;/span&gt;        &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; (c &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;is&lt;/span&gt; Eventos_EventosRealizados)






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  18:  &lt;/span&gt;        {






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  19:  &lt;/span&gt;            ((Eventos_EventosRealizados)c).UpdateCallback = delCallback;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  20:  &lt;/span&gt;        }






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  21:  &lt;/span&gt;    }






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  22:  &lt;/span&gt;}






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  23:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  24:  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; Control ChangeSection(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; _sControl)






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  25:  &lt;/span&gt;{






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  26:  &lt;/span&gt;    Control c = &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.LoadControl(_sControl);






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  27:  &lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  28:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Put a 3 seconds delay so that we can see the magic happen -- remove in the final version&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  29:  &lt;/span&gt;    System.Threading.Thread.Sleep(3000);






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  30:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  31:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;.ContentArea.Controls.Add(c);    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Add the control to the page&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  32:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  33:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Important: Set its ID or the event might not be fired,&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  34:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// since ASP.Net uses the control ID to find it&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  35:  &lt;/span&gt;    c.ID = &lt;span class="str"&gt;"ContentUserControl"&lt;/span&gt;;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  36:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  37:  &lt;/span&gt;    ViewState[&lt;span class="str"&gt;"CurrentControl"&lt;/span&gt;] = _sControl;  &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// store the control name in the ViewState&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  38:  &lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  39:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="rem"&gt;// Execute some javascript routine to refresh the screen (if needed)&lt;/span&gt;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  40:  &lt;/span&gt;    ScriptManager.RegisterStartupScript(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;typeof&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;this&lt;/span&gt;), &lt;span class="str"&gt;"some script key"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="str"&gt;"&lt;script type="&lt;/span&gt;text/javascript&lt;span class="str"&gt;"&gt;refreshPage();&lt;/script&gt;"&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;);






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  41:  &lt;/span&gt; 






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  42:  &lt;/span&gt;    &lt;span class="kwrd"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; c;






&lt;span class="lnum"&gt;  43:  &lt;/span&gt;}

<p>So these are just some basic guidelines for handling user controls dynamically. If you need further info, <a href="http://asp.net">asp.net</a> official website is always a great place to start off and watch with some videos.</p>

<p>Till next time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just found out that there is an effort at Microsoft together with the jQuery team in order to add intellisense support for this framework in Visual Studio 2008. We all know that the javascript intellisense support in VS has always been almost none, but now it seems that the guys at Microsoft are changing the way and starting to support it progressively, starting by including it in its ASP.NET MVC package and adding intellisense support for interaction with the AJAX framework.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been trying to enable this functionality today and found out that it just isn&#8217;t worth the effort, at least for the latest jQuery version (1.3.2). Basically, you need to first off <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/11/21/jquery-intellisense-in-vs-2008.aspx">install a patch</a> to enable the functionality. Then, you&#8217;ll need a -vsdocs.js file, which is just an API descriptor containing all the documentation for the framework. It is not actually a js file. You can find more detailed information <a href="http://blogs.ipona.com/james/archive/2009/01/14/jquery-1.3-and-visual-studio-2008-intellisense.aspx">here</a>. Then, JScript IntelliSense will parse all the included js files and check for errors. If it thinks that one of your included script files isn&#8217;t good, intellisense just won&#8217;t work. The problem is that it complains about the actual jQuery file not being well formed:</p>

<p><strong>&#8220;Warning</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>15</strong><strong>  </strong><strong>Error updating JScript IntelliSense: C:&#8230;.\javascript\jquery-1.3.js: Object doesn&#8217;t support this property or method @ 2069:1&#8221;</strong></p>

<p>Just to shorten the story, you&#8217;ll get to spend some time trying to make it to work, probably without success and then will give up miserably (my case). The fact is that it just isn&#8217;t worth all the work, while you still have a <a href="http://docs.jquery.com/Main_Page">decent online documentation</a> to help.</p>

<p>In the end, you&#8217;ll have to calm down and wait a little bit while Visual Studio 2010 is still beta since jQuery will be shipped with VS2010 and it will include built-in robust intellisense and documentation (not from a downloaded patch). This is good news for us all! In the meantime, let&#8217;s wait for the final release :)</p>

<p>[Update 07/17/2009]</p>

<p>Just ran into a great post about this exactly same subject at <a href="http://www.learningjquery.com/2009/07/setting-up-visual-studio-intellisense-for-jquery#more-822">learninjquery.com</a> which was an eye-opener to me. It is actually very simple to make it work if you know exactly what has to be done. And what has to be done is just to add the /// reference comment to the start of your javascript file and everything works seamlessly. No need to include the -vsdocs in the actual html file at all! Of course that if you have different scenarios like custom controls, dynamically generated javascript, etc., this may become painful again, but for the regular usage, this post at learningjquery.com will set you will all that is needed to be ready to go in minutes.</p>
