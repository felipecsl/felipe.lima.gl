  <div class="post-content e-content" itemprop="articleBody"><p>I pretty much always had a side project that I‚Äôve focused on during my free time. They‚Äôve fallen in a wide variety of categories, from small pet projects (eg.: playing with libraries and tools that I wanted to learn more about) to bigger and more ambitious ideas that I wanted to eventually ‚Äúsucceed‚Äù and have paying users for it. That ended up never happening, <a href="https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/coinverse">except once</a>, with Coinverse, for a brief period of time only.</p>

<p>The vast majority of them either ended up being shelved (abandoned), mostly because I ended up losing interest on it. I guess that once things get boring and no longer challenging, that‚Äôs when I stop working on it and focus on something new.</p>

<p><strong>Side projects are a great way to learn new things, experiment, try and fail in a safe and controlled environment, with low stakes, where having fun is the only goal.</strong></p>

<p>Recently I‚Äôve realized how my approach has changed drastically over the years. I still remember the first project I launched publicly with friends, <a href="http://noitehoje.com.br/">Noite Hoje</a>. It was an aggregator for parties, concerts and events for (usually young) people who wanted to find something to do on a Friday or Saturday night, for example, and didn‚Äôt know what events were happening around them. I remember being extremely thrilled about it, working nights and weekends nonstop. We were a group of friends, young and naive. I recall us discussing about how that could become a huge project with millions of paying users. So foolish üòÄ. We did end up making some noise though, being featured in <a href="https://link.estadao.com.br/blogs/daniel-gonzales/dez-apps-de-musica-e-entretenimento-para-android-ios-e-windows-phone/">local newspapers</a> and <a href="https://www.techtudo.com.br/noticias/noticia/2011/08/noite-hoje-mostra-melhores-baladas-e-shows-da-sua-cidade-no-celular.html">media outlets</a>, but it didn‚Äôt last for very long. It was a wild and short ride with a lot of drama included. Needless to say, the project is <a href="https://github.com/noitehoje">now archived</a>.</p>

<p>I‚Äôm now working on <a href="https://clairvoyancehq.com/">something new</a> which I‚Äôm again thrilled about in a way that I haven‚Äôt been in a long time, probably years. This time, however, I want to make sure this doesn‚Äôt end up in an archived Github repo again. I want to make sure I don‚Äôt lose interest and move over to the next shiny thing as it has happened over and over again. I think the key is <strong>consistency</strong>.</p>

<p>Instead of working nights and weekends nonstop, as I have many times before, which is not sustainable, this time I want to pace myself and make it last in the long run. In the end, this is a marathon, not a sprint. Time to market is key, but what‚Äôs the point if you get burned out and abandon it weeks later?</p>

  <p>Do something every day. It almost doesn‚Äôt matter what it is, as long as you do something.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Fix a bug, a typo. Update a layout. Merge a pull request. Document a class. It doesn‚Äôt matter how small it is, as long as you do it consistently.</p>

<p>This applies to so many areas that it almost feels like beating a dead horse, old news. Exercise every day. Eat healthy every day. Sleep well every night. The power of compound growth is often underestimated and humans often have a hard time grasping it.</p>
