In C#, you are not able to serialize an object that does not have a parameterless constructor. At least, XmlSerializer is not able to do this. It seems like BinaryFormatter is able, as per this [StackOverflow question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/267724/why-serializable-class-need-a-parameterless-constructor).






This means you are not able to Xml serialize some object like this, also:






[code:c#]






var myObj = new  

{  

MyPropertyString = "prop1value",  

MyPropertyInt = 2,  

MyPropertyList = new List<string> { "bananas", "apples", "pees" }  

});






[/code]






I needed to be able to serialize this kind of object to database in a human-readable format so, if you don't need to output in Xml format specifically, you can try this great [Json.NET library](http://james.newtonking.com/projects/json-net.aspx) by James Newton-King, that worked smoothly for me, as easy as:






[code:c#]






string jsonString = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(_myObj);






[/code]






Surely you can do many other things with this library, which you can find out by yourself.
