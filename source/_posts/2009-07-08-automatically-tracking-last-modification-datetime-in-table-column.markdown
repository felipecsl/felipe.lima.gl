Lately I found a very simple and yet consistent way to track the last update made to a Sql Server database table. You can easily store the modification date and time through a table trigger that can set a specific column of the updated row(s) with the GETDATE() function.






In order to do that, create a new trigger for your table and use the **Inserted** virtual table to obtain the ID of the entry, in order to update it. We'll use here a **LastModified **column, which will store a datetime:






CREATE TRIGGER last_modification_timestamp  

ON target_table  

AFTER INSERT, UPDATE  

AS   

DECLARE @colID INT  

SELECT @colID = (SELECT ID FROM Inserted)  

UPDATE target_table SET LastModified = GETDATE() WHERE ID = @colID






So, we're basically retrieving the column ID (primary key) from the affected row and using it to update the LastModified column with the current date and time.






This way, you can enforce this policy and guarantee that you'll always get the correct date/time in that column, since the trigger will be automatically executed just after each INSERT and DELETE.






Hope this helps!
